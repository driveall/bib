abstract = {The need for efficient corpus indexing and querying arises frequently both in machine
learning-based and human-engineered natural language processing systems. This paper presents the ANNIC system, which can index documents not only by content, but also by their linguististic annotations and features. It also enables users to formulate versatile queries mixing keywords and linguistic information. The result consists of the matching texts in the corpus, displayed within the context of linguistic annotations (not just text, as is customary for KWIC systems). The data is displayed in a graphical user interface, which facilitates its exploration and the discovery of new patterns, which can in turn be tested by launching new ANNIC queries.},

abstract ={Instance unification determines whether two instances in an ontology
 refer to the same object in the real world. More specifically, this paper
 addresses the instance unification problem for person names. The approach
 combines the use of citation information (i.e., abstract, initials, titles and
 co-authorship information) with web mining, in order to gather additional
 evidence for the instance unification algorithm. The method is evaluated on
 two datasets --- one from the BT digital library and one used in previous work
 on name disambiguation. The results show that the information mined from the
 web contributes substantially towards the successful handling of highly
  ambiguous cases which lowered the performance of previous methods.}

 Communication, {Emotion/Affect } , Social Involvement,
 Motivation, and Retardation. The latent structure of
 the { NSA-16 } is similar to the larger instrument
 from which it was derived. The findings provide
                  support for a multidimensional model of negative

abstract = {User-contributed messages on social media sites such as Twitter have emerged aspowerful, real-time means of information sharing on the Web. These short messages tend to reflect a variety of events in real time, making Twitter particularly well suited as a source of real-time event content. In this paper, we explore approaches for analyzing the stream of Twitter messages to distinguish between messages about real-world events andnon-event messages. Our approach relies on a rich family of aggregatestatistics of topically similar message clusters. Large-scale experiments over millions of Twitter messages show the effectiveness of our approach for surfacing real-world event content on Twitter.},
annote = {This approach concentrates on detecting events. A real time clustering algorithm is used to form communities of tweets, then a classifier is trained to discover which of those communities correspond to events.

Novel features are used such as volume of tweets over time, as well as social features like the types and quantity user interactions, and the topics discussed (such as the number of key words which appear).

This paper contains some useful outline discussion of the issues relating to the diversity of tweets and the definition of events.},

abstract = {Social media sites such as Twitter contain large amounts of user contributed messages for a wide variety of real-world events. While some of these "event messages" might contain interesting and useful information (e.g., event time, location, participants, opinions), others might provide little value (e.g., using heavy slang, incomprehensible language) to people interested in learning about an event. Techniques for effective selection of quality event content may therefore help improve applications such as event browsing and search.In this paper, we explore approaches for finding representative messages among a set of Twitter messages that correspond to the same event, with the goal of identifying high quality, relevant messages that provide useful event information. We evaluate our approaches using a large-scale dataset of Twitter messages, and show that we can automatically select event messages that are both relevant and useful.},
annote = {This continues the work described in "Beyond Trending topics" - tweets are selected from the clusters based on three different measures. The measures are distance to centroid, degree centrality and LexRank centrality. It was found that the cosine distance to the centroid seemed to be the "best" way to select content, though cannot rule out that all approaches work equally well.

The evaluation assumed that selected tweets must have the attributes of quality, relevance and usefulness. Human annotators were asked to assign scores to the top-5 tweets according to these attributes. They claimed that annotators agree strongly on the scores.},

 techninques for natural language processing (NLP) application development. This paper adopts a point of
 view of designing industrial strength NLP frameworks, where emerging notions include a pipelined
 architecture, open-ended intercomponent communication, and the adoption of linguistic annotations as
 fundamental analytic/descriptive device. For such frameworks, certain issues arise operational and
     notational concerning the underlying data stream over which the FS machinery operates. The paper reviews
 recent work on finite-state processing of annotations and highlight some essential features required from
 a congenial architecture for NLP aiming to be broadly applicable to, and configurable for, an open-ended
 set of tasks.},

@article{Bollen2009,
abstract = {Microblogging is a form of online communication by which users broadcast brief text updates, also known as tweets, to the public or a selected circle of contacts. A variegated mosaic of microblogging uses has emerged since the launch of Twitter in 2006: daily chatter, conversation, information sharing, and news commentary, among others. Regardless of their content and intended use, tweets often convey pertinent information about their author's mood status. As such, tweets can be regarded as temporally-authentic microscopic instantiations of public mood state. In this article, we perform a sentiment analysis of all public tweets broadcasted by Twitter users between August 1 and December 20, 2008. For every day in the timeline, we extract six dimensions of mood (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion) using an extended version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), a well-established psychometric instrument. We compare our results to fluctuations recorded by stock market and crude oil price indices and major events in media and popular culture, such as the U.S. Presidential Election of November 4, 2008 and Thanksgiving Day. We find that events in the social, political, cultural and economic sphere do have a significant, immediate and highly specific effect on the various dimensions of public mood. We speculate that large scale analyses of mood can provide a solid platform to model collective emotive trends in terms of their predictive value with regards to existing social as well as economic indicators.},

 solve software engineering related problems show promising results, the very
 basic process of augmenting software artifacts with their semantic
 representations is still an open issue. Indeed, exiting techniques to learn
 ontologies that describe the domain of a certain software project either 1)
 explore only one information source associated to this project or 2) employ
 supervised and domain specific techniques. In this paper we present an
 ontology learning approach that 1) exploits a range of information sources
 associated with software projects and 2) relies on techniques that are
 portable across application domains}

abstract = {Twitter has become exceedingly popular, with hundreds of millions of tweets being posted every day on a wide variety of topics. This has helped make real-time search applications possible with leading search engines routinely displaying relevant tweets in response to user queries. Recent research has shown that a considerable fraction of these tweets are about "events," and the detection of novel events in the tweet-stream has attracted a lot of research interest. However, very little research has focused on properly displaying this real-time information about events. For instance, the leading search engines simply display all tweets matching the queries in reverse chronological order. In this paper we argue that for some highly structured and recurring events, such as sports, it is better to use more sophisticated techniques to summarize the relevant tweets. We formalize the problem of summarizing event-tweets and give a solution based on learning the underlying hidden state representation of the event via Hidden Markov Models. In addition, through extensive experiments on real-world data we show that our model significantly outperforms some intuitive and competitive baselines.},
annote = {The authors of this paper claim that it is the first approach to actually summarising tweets in terms of the events that they mention. Groups of tweets are retreived by hashtags, though they argue that simply showing the most recent tweets in response to a keyword search leads to uninformative and duplicate messages. They attempt to segment tweets into the sub-events they might mention, and summarise those by selecting the tweets with the greatest similarity to all others in that group.

The segmentation is completed using a variant of a hidden markov model, which was trained for the domain of american football matches ahead of time. They claim that their approach could be used to characterise other types of events.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The integration of the rapidly expanding corpus of information about the genome, transcriptome, and proteome, engendered by powerful technological advances, such as microarrays, and the availability of genomic sequence from multiple species, challenges the grasp and comprehension of the scientific community. Despite the existence of text-mining methods that identify biological relationships based on the textual co-occurrence of gene/protein terms or similarities in abstract texts, knowledge of the underlying molecular connections on a large scale, which is prerequisite to understanding novel biological processes, lags far behind the accumulation of data. While computationally efficient, the co-occurrence-based approaches fail to characterize (e.g., inhibition or stimulation, directionality) biological interactions. Programs with natural language processing (NLP) capability have been created to address these limitations, however, they are in general not readily accessible to the public.RESULTS:We present a NLP-based text-mining approach, Chilibot, which constructs content-rich relationship networks among biological concepts, genes, proteins, or drugs. Amongst its features, suggestions for new hypotheses can be generated. Lastly, we provide evidence that the connectivity of molecular networks extracted from the biological literature follows the power-law distribution, indicating scale-free topologies consistent with the results of previous experimental analyses.CONCLUSIONS:Chilibot distills scientific relationships from knowledge available throughout a wide range of biological domains and presents these in a content-rich graphical format, thus integrating general biomedical knowledge with the specialized knowledge and interests of the user.

abstract = {Large volumes of user-generated content on practically every major issue and event are being created on the microblogging site Twitter. This content can be combined and processed to detect events, entities and popular moods to feed various knowledge-intensive practical applications. On the downside, these content items are very noisy and highly informal, making it difficult to extract sense out of the stream. In this paper, we exploit various approaches to detect the named entities and significant micro-events from users' tweets during a live sports event. Here we describe how combining linguistic features with background knowledge and the use of Twitter-specific features can achieve high, precise detection results (f-measure = 87\%) in different datasets. A study was conducted on tweets from cricket matches in the ICC World Cup in order to augment the event-related non-textual media with collective intelligence.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Annotation of proteins with gene ontology (GO) terms is ongoing work and a complex task. Manual GO annotation is precise and precious, but it is time-consuming. Therefore, instead of curated annotations most of the proteins come with uncurated annotations, which have been generated automatically. Text-mining systems that use literature for automatic annotation have been proposed but they do not satisfy the high quality expectations of curators.RESULTS:In this paper we describe an approach that links uncurated annotations to text extracted from literature. The selection of the text is based on the similarity of the text to the term from the uncurated annotation. Besides substantiating the uncurated annotations, the extracted texts also lead to novel annotations. In addition, the approach uses the GO hierarchy to achieve high precision. Our approach is integrated into GOAnnotator, a tool that assists the curation process for GO annotation of UniProt proteins.CONCLUSION:The GO curators assessed GOAnnotator with a set of 66 distinct UniProt/SwissProt proteins with uncurated annotations. GOAnnotator provided correct evidence text at 93% precision. This high precision results from using the GO hierarchy to only select GO terms similar to GO terms from uncurated annotations in GOA. Our approach is the first one to achieve high precision, which is crucial for the efficient support of GO curators. GOAnnotator was implemented as a web tool that is freely available at http://xldb.di.fc.ul.pt/rebil/tools/goa/ webcite.}

A model is presented which allows individual error-rates to be estimated for polytomous facets even when the patient's "true" response is not available. The EM algorithm is shown to provide a slow but sure way of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of interest. Some preliminary experience is reported and the limitations of the method are described.},

As a step towards interconnecting the Web of Documents with the Web of Data, we developed DBpedia Spotlight, a system for automatically annotating text documents with DBpedia URIs. DBpedia Spotlight allows users to configure the annotations to their specific needs through the DBpedia Ontology and quality measures such as prominence, topical pertinence, contextual ambiguity and disambiguation confidence. We compare our approach with the state of the art in disambiguation, and evaluate our results in light of three baselines and six publicly available annotation systems, demonstrating the competitiveness of our system. DBpedia Spotlight is shared as open source and deployed as a Web Service freely available for public use.}

abstract = {The semantic web represents a major advance in web utility, but it
	is currently difficult to create semantic-web content because pages
	must be semantically annotated through processes that are mostly
	manual and require a high degree of engineering skill. Furthermore,
	users need an effective way to query the semantic web, but any burden
	placed on users to learn a query language is unlikely to garner sufficient
	user support and interest. Unfortunately, both the creation and use
	of semantic-web pages are difficult, and these are precisely the
	processes that must be made simple in order for the semantic web
	to truly succeed. We propose using information-extraction ontologies
	to handle both of these challenges. In this paper we show how a successful
	ontology-based data-extraction technique can (1) automatically generate
	semantic annotations for ordinary web pages, and (2) support free-form,
	textual queries that will be relatively simple for end users to write.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The majority of experimentally verified molecular interaction and biological pathway data are present in the unstructured text of biomedical journal articles where they are inaccessible to computational methods. The Biomolecular interaction network database (BIND) seeks to capture these data in a machine-readable format. We hypothesized that the formidable task-size of backfilling the database could be reduced by using Support Vector Machine technology to first locate interaction information in the literature. We present an information extraction system that was designed to locate protein-protein interaction data in the literature and present these data to curators and the public for review and entry into BIND.RESULTS:Cross-validation estimated the support vector machine's test-set precision, accuracy and recall for classifying abstracts describing interaction information was 92%, 90% and 92% respectively. We estimated that the system would be able to recall up to 60% of all non-high throughput interactions present in another yeast-protein interaction database. Finally, this system was applied to a real-world curation problem and its use was found to reduce the task duration by 70% thus saving 176 days.CONCLUSIONS:Machine learning methods are useful as tools to direct interaction and pathway database back-filling; however, this potential can only be realized if these techniques are coupled with human review and entry into a factual database such as BIND. The PreBIND system described here is available to the public at http://bind.ca webcite. Current capabilities allow searching for human, mouse and yeast protein-interaction information.}

This resulted in more effective indexing than would have been possible if the programme transcript was indexed directly, owing to the poor quality of transcripts produced using automatic speech recognition. In addition, the
associations produced between web pages and television broadcasts enables the automatic creation of augmented interactive television broadcasts and multi-media websites.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:With the rapid expansion of scientific research, the ability to effectively find or integrate new domain knowledge in the sciences is proving increasingly difficult. Efforts to improve and speed up scientific discovery are being explored on a number of fronts. However, much of this work is based on traditional search and retrieval approaches and the bibliographic citation presentation format remains unchanged.METHODS:Case study.RESULTS:The Telemakus KnowledgeBase System provides flexible new tools for creating knowledgebases to facilitate retrieval and review of scientific research reports. In formalizing the representation of the research methods and results of scientific reports, Telemakus offers a potential strategy to enhance the scientific discovery process. While other research has demonstrated that aggregating and analyzing research findings across domains augments knowledge discovery, the Telemakus system is unique in combining document surrogates with interactive concept maps of linked relationships across groups of research reports.CONCLUSION:Based on how scientists conduct research and read the literature, the Telemakus KnowledgeBase System brings together three innovations in analyzing, displaying and summarizing research reports across a domain: (1) research report schema, a document surrogate of extracted research methods and findings presented in a consistent and structured schema format which mimics the research process itself and provides a high-level surrogate to facilitate searching and rapid review of retrieved documents; (2) research findings, used to index the documents, allowing searchers to request, for example, research studies which have studied the relationship between neoplasms and vitamin E; and (3) visual exploration interface of linked relationships for interactive querying of research findings across the knowledgebase and graphical displays of what is known as well as, through gaps in the map, what is yet to be tested. The rationale and system architecture are described and plans for the future are discussed.}

  processing that language and manipulating an ontology. The input sentences
  are analysed deterministically and compositionally with respect to a given
  ontology, which the software consults in order to interpret the input's
 semantics; this allows the user to learn fewer syntactic structures since some
 of them can be used to refer to either classes or instances, for example. A
 repeated-measures, task-based evaluation has been carried out in comparison
 with a well-known ontology editor; our software received favourable results
 for basic tasks. The paper also discusses work in progress and future plans
  for developing this language and tool},

 multi-source, multilingual information extraction. Structured, semistructured
 and unstructured documents of various types are annotated using a range of
 hand-crafted and machine-learning information extraction processes; the
 resulting annotations are used as statements to update a knowledge base for
 business intelligence. Our approach in particular uses domainoriented
 ontologies that extend the de facto Proton standard to ensure compatibility
 between the extracted data so that they can be integrated into a consistent,
 precise set of results},

The purpose of this project is to build an algorithm that can accurately classify Twitter messages as positive or negative, with respect to a query term. Our hypothesis is that we can obtain high accuracy on classifying sentiment in Twitter messages using machine learning techniques. Generally, this type of sentiment analysis is useful for consumers who are trying to research a product or service, or marketers researching public opinion of their company.},

abstract = {We investigate the possibility of using Semantic Web data to improve hypertext Web search. In particular, we use relevance feedback to create a `virtuous cycle' between data gathered from the Semantic Web of Linked Data and web-pages gathered from the hypertext Web. Previous approaches have generally considered the searching over the Semantic Web and hypertext Web to be entirely disparate, indexing and searching over different domains. While relevance feedback has traditionally improved information retrieval performance, relevance feedback is normally used to improve rankings over a single data-set. Our novel approach is to use relevance feedback from hypertext Web results to improve Semantic Web search, and results from the Semantic Web to improve the retrieval of hypertext Web data. In both cases, an evaluation is performed based on certain kinds of informational queries (abstract concepts, people, and places) selected from a real-life query log and checked by human judges. We evaluate our work over a wide range of algorithms and options, and show it improves baseline performance on these queries for deployed systems as well, such as the Semantic Web Search engine FALCON-S and Yahoo! Web search. We further show that the use of Semantic Web inference seems to hurt performance, while the pseudo- relevance feedback increases performance in both cases, although not as much as actual relevance feedback. Lastly, our evaluation is the first rigorous `Cranfield' evaluation of Semantic Web search.}

doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bti1142},
abstract ={Motivation: The World Wide Web has profoundly changed the
 way in which we access information. Searching the
 internet is easy and fast, but more importantly, the
 interconnection of related contents makes it
 intuitive and closer to the associative organization
 of human memory. However, the information retrieval
 tools currently available to researchers in biology
 and medicine lag far behind the possibilities that
 the layman has come to expect from the
 internet.Results: By using genes and proteins as
 hyperlinks between sentences and abstracts, the
 information in PubMed can be converted into one
                  navigable resource. iHOP (Information Hyperlinked
 over Proteins) is an online service that provides
 this gene-guided network as a natural way of
 accessing millions of PubMed abstracts and brings
 all the advantages of the internet to scientific
 literature research. Navigating across interrelated
 sentences within this network is closer to human
 intuition than the use of conventional keyword
 searches and allows for stepwise and controlled
 acquisition of information. Moreover, this
 literature network can be superimposed upon
 experimental interaction data to facilitate the
                  simultaneous analysis of novel and existing
 knowledge. The network presented in iHOP currently
 contains5 million sentences and 40 000 genes from
 Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster,
 Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Arabidopsis
 thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia
 coli.Availability: iHOP is freely accessible at

abstract = {The problem of automatic extraction of sentiment expressions from informal text, as in microblogs such as tweets is a recent area of investigation. Compared to formal text, such as in product reviews or news articles, one of the key challenges lies in the wide diversity and informal nature of sentiment expressions that cannot be trivially enumerated or captured using predefined lexical patterns. In this work, we present an optimization-based approach to automatically extract sentiment expressions for a given target (e.g., movie, or person) from a corpus of unlabeled tweets. Specifically, we make three contributions: (i) we recognize a diverse and richer set of sentiment-bearing expressions in tweets, including formal and slang words/phrases, not limited to pre-specified syntactic patterns; (ii) instead of associating sentiment with an entire tweet, we assess the target-dependent polarity of each sentiment expression. The polarity of sentiment expression is determined by the nature of its target; (iii) we provide a novel formulation of assigning polarity to a sentiment expression as a constrained optimization problem over the tweet corpus. Experiments conducted on two domains, tweets mentioning movie and person entities, show that our approach improves accuracy in comparison with several baseline methods, and that the improvement becomes more prominent with increasing corpus sizes.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Despite increasing interest in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to biomedical text, whether this technology can facilitate tasks such as database curation remains unclear.RESULTS:PaperBrowser is the first NLP-powered interface that was developed under a user-centered approach to improve the way in which FlyBase curators navigate an article. In this paper, we first discuss how observing curators at work informed the design and evaluation of PaperBrowser. Then, we present how we appraise PaperBrowser's navigational functionalities in a user-based study using a text highlighting task and evaluation criteria of Human-Computer Interaction. Our results show that PaperBrowser reduces the amount of interactions between two highlighting events and therefore improves navigational efficiency by about 58% compared to the navigational mechanism that was previously available to the curators. Moreover, PaperBrowser is shown to provide curators with enhanced navigational utility by over 74% irrespective of the different ways in which they highlight text in the article.CONCLUSION:We show that state-of-the-art performance in certain NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition and Anaphora Resolution can be combined with the navigational functionalities of PaperBrowser to support curation quite successfully.}

abstract = {The variable results of positive-negative research
 with schizophrenics underscore the importance of
 well-characterized, standardized measurement
 techniques. We report on the development and initial
 standardization of the Positive and Negative
 Syndrome Scale ( { PANSS) } for typological and
 dimensional assessment. Based on two established
 psychiatric rating systems, the 30-item {PANSS } was
 conceived as an operationalized, drug-sensitive
 instrument that provides balanced representation of
 positive and negative symptoms and gauges their
 relationship to one another and to global
 psychopathology. It thus constitutes four scales
 measuring positive and negative syndromes, their
                  differential, and general severity of illness. Study
 of 101 schizophrenics found the four scales to be
 normally distributed and supported their reliability
 and stability. Positive and negative scores were
 inversely correlated once their common association
 with general psychopathology was extracted,
                  suggesting that they represent mutually exclusive
 constructs. Review of five studies involving the
 { PANSS } provided evidence of its criterion-related
 validity with antecedent, genealogical, and
 concurrent measures, its predictive validity, its
 drug sensitivity, and its utility for both
 typological and dimensional assessment.},

Toward overcoming this problem we study in this paper the comment summarization problem: for a set of n user-contributed comments associated with an online resource, select the best top-k comments for summarization. In this paper we propose (i) a clustering-based approach for identifying correlated groups of comments; and (ii) a precedence-based ranking framework for automatically selecting informative user-contributed comments. We find that in combination, these two salient features yield promising results.}

abstract = {Abstract: Many experts predict that the next huge step forward in Web information technology will beachieved by adding semantics to Web data, and will possibly consist of (some form of) the SemanticWeb. In this paper, we present a novel approach to Semantic Web search, which allows for a semanticprocessing of Web search queries, and for evaluating complex Web search queries that involvereasoning over the Web. More specifically, we first add ontological structure and semantics to Webpages, which then allows for both attaching a meaning to Web search queries and Web pages, and forformulating and processing ontology-based complex Web search queries (that is, conjunctive queries)that involve reasoning over the Web. Here, we assume the existence of an underlying ontology (in alightweight ontology language) relative to which Web pages are annotated and Web search queries areformulated. Depending on whether we use a general or a specialized ontology, we thus obtain a generalor a vertical Semantic Web search interface, respectively. That is, we are actually mapping the Web intoan ontological knowledge base, which then allows for Semantic Web search relative to the underlyingontology. The latter is then realized by reduction to standard Web search on standard Web pages andlogically completed ontological annotations. That is, standard Web search engines are used as the maininference motor for ontology-based Semantic Web search. We develop the formal model behind thisapproach and also provide an implementation in desktop search. Furthermore, we report on extensiveexperiments, including a implemented Semantic Web search on the Internet Movie Database.}

Semantic annotation and ontologybased information extraction technologies form the cornerstone of such applications. There has been a great deal of work in the last decade on evaluating traditional information extraction (IE) systems in terms of performance, but such methods are not sufficient for ontology-based systems. Furthermore, usability aspects need to be considered such as scalability, accessibility and interoperability. We outline the main requirements in terms of both usability and performance, proposing possible solutions and using examples of existing tools and resources.},

abstract = {The evaluation of the quality of ontological
 classification is an important part of semantic web technology. Because this
 area is under constant development, it requires improvement and
 standardisation. This paper discusses existing evaluation metrics, and
 proposes a new method for evaluating the ontology population task, which is
 general enough to be used in a variety of situations, yet more precise than
 many current metrics. The paper further describes our first efforts in
 operationalising the evaluation procedure, including the creation of a
 semantically annotated corpus that will function as a test bed for the
 proposed evaluation mechanism, and comparison of different evaluation
 metrics. We conclude that for ontology-based evaluation, a more complex
 mechanism than is traditionally used is preferable. This mechanism aims to
 drive a benchmarking assessment tool for the current state-of-the-art of
 ontology population, and to set a standard for best practice for future
 evaluation of human language technology for the semantic web.}

 traditional data mining tools make use of numerical data and cannot easily
 be applied to knowledge extracted from free text, traditional information
 extraction is either not adapted for the financial domain, or does not
    address the issue of information integration: the merging of information
    from different kinds of sources. We describe here the development of a
 system for content mining using domain ontologies, which enables the
 extraction of relevant information to be fed into models for analysis of
 financial and operational risk and other business intelligence applications
 such as company intelligence, by means of the XBRL standard. The results so
 far are of extremely high quality, due to the implementation of primarily
 high-precision rules}

 ontologies need to be dynamic, networked structures. One important
    challenge, therefore, is to develop an integrated approach to the evolution
 process of ontologies and related metadata. Within this context, the
 specific goal of this work is to capture the evolution of metadata due to
 changed concepts, relations or metadata in one of the ontologies, and to
 capture changes to the ontology caused by changes to the metadata. After a
    short discussion of the nature of metadata, we propose a methodology to
 capture (1) the evolution of metadata induced by changes to the ontologies,
 and (2) the evolution of the ontology induced by changes to the underlying
 metadata. This will lead to the implementation of an approach for evolution
 of metadata related to ontologies},

Part of this effort is the automatic curation of knowledge from the massive amount of information on fungal enzymes that is available in genomics. Working closely with biologists who manually curate the existing literature, we developed ontological NLP pipelines, integrated through Web-based interfaces, to help them in two main tasks: spending less time to mine the literature for facts, while also being provided with richer and semantically linked information. An ongoing challenge is to measure precisely how much the developed semantic technologies benefit the end users and what their overall impact on the quality of the curated data is. We present preliminary evaluation results that show a significant reduction in manual curation time. },

                  the system achieves sensitivity of 80% with
 specificity of 82%. DTFAM provides comprehensive
 tabular and graphical reports linking terms to
                  relevant sets of documents. These documents are
 color-coded for easier inspection. DTFAM complements
 the existing biological resources by collecting,
 assessing, extracting and presenting associations
 that can reveal some of the not so easily observable
 connections among the entities found which could
 explain the functions of TFs and help decipher parts
                  of gene transcriptional regulatory networks. DTFAM
 summarizes information from a large volume of
 documents saving time and making analysis simpler
                  for individual users. DTFAM is freely available for
 academic and non-profit users at

Applied to political alignment detection, ethnicity classification and business fan detection.


Models user topic interests using LDA. Other lexical features include prototypical words and hashtags gathered from seed users. Linguistic features are seen to perform considerably better than those based on user behaviour. Social features are best of all but are difficult to collect.


Main classifier is Gradient Boosted Decision trees (sounds arcane), which are faster and more efficient than but competitive with SVMs.

abstract = {In the menagerie of tasks for information extraction, entity linking is a new beast that has drawn a lot of attention from NLP practitioners and researchers recently. Entity Linking, also referred to as record linkage or entity resolution, involves aligning a textual mention of a named-entity to an appropriate entry in a knowledge base, which may or may not contain the entity. This has manifold applications ranging from linking patient health records to maintaining personal credit files, prevention of identity crimes, and supporting law enforcement. We discuss the key challenges present in this task and we present a high-performing system that links entities using max-margin ranking. We also summarize recent work in this area and describe several open research problems.}

 information extraction and other natural language processing tools key
  enablers for the acquisition and use of that semantic information. We describe
 the application of ontology-based extraction and merging in the context of a
 practical e-business application for the EU MUSING Project where the goal is
 to gather international company intelligence and country/region information.
 The results of our experiments so far are very promising and we are now in the
  process of building a complete end-to-end solution},

@inproceedings{Sakaki2010,
abstract = {Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96\% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.},

abstract ={Motivation: Text mining systems aim at knowledge discovery from text collections. This work presents our text mining algorithm and demonstrates its use to uncover information that could form the basis of new hypotheses. In particular, we use it to discover novel uses for Curcuma longa, a dietary substance, which is highly regarded for its therapeutic properties in Asia.Results: Several disease were identified that offer novel research contexts for curcumin. We analyze select suggestions, such as retinal diseases, Crohn's disease and disorders related to the spinal cord. Our analysis suggests that there is strong evidence in favor of a beneficial role for curcumin in these diseases. The evidence is based on curcumin's influence on several genes, such as COX-2, TNF-alpha, JNK, p38 MAPK and TGF-beta. This research suggests that our discovery algorithm may be used to suggest novel uses for dietary and pharmacological substances. More generally, our text mining algorithm may be used to uncover information that potentially sheds new light on a given topic of interest.Availability: Contact authors.},

keywords = {tagging;motivation;folksonomies},
abstract = {While recent progress has been achieved in understanding the structure and dynamics of social tagging systems, we know little about the underlying user motivations for tagging, and how they influence resulting folksonomies and tags. This paper addresses three issues related to this question: 1.) What motivates users to tag resources, and in what ways is user motivation amenable to quantitative analysis? 2.) Does users' motivation for tagging vary within and across social tagging systems, and if so how? and 3.) How does variability in user motivation influence resulting tags and folksonomies? In this paper, we present measures to detect whether a tagger is primarily motivated by categorizing or describing resources, and apply the measures to datasets from 8 different tagging systems. Our results show that a) users' motivation for tagging varies not only across, but also within tagging systems, and that b) tag agreement among users who are motivated by categorizing resources is significantly lower than among users who are motivated by describing resources. Our findings are relevant for (i) the development of tag recommenders, (ii) the analysis of tag semantics and (iii) the design of search algorithms for social tagging systems.},

abstract = {In recent years, following the rapid development in the Semantic
  Web and Knowledge Management research, ontologies have become more in demand
 in Natural Language Processing. An increasing number of systems use ontologies
 either internally, for modelling the domain of the application, or as data
 structures that hold the output resulting from the work of the system, in the
 form of knowledge bases. While there are many ontology editing tools aimed at
 expert users, there are very few which are accessible to users wishing to
 create simple structures without delving into the intricacies of knowledge
 representation languages. The approach described in this paper allows users to
 create and edit ontologies simply by using a restricted version of the English
 language. The controlled language described within is based on an open
 vocabulary and a restricted set of grammatical constructs. Sentences written
 in this language unambiguously map into a number of knowledge representation
  formats including OWL and RDF-S to allow round-trip ontology management}

abstract = {Sumerian is a long-extinct language documented throughout the
ancient Middle East, arguably the first language for which we have written
  evidence, and is a language isolate (i.e. no related languages have so far
been identified). The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL),
based at the University of Oxford, aims to make accessible on the web over 350
 literary works composed during the late third and early second millennia BCE.
  The transliterations and translations can be searched, browsed and read online
 using the tools of the website. In this paper we describe the creation of
linguistic analysis and corpus search tools for Sumerian, as part of the
development of the ETCSL. This is designed to enable Sumerian scholars,
students and interested laymen to analyse the texts online and electronically,
 and to further knowledge about the language.}

abstract = {Cloud computing is increasingly being regarded as a key enabler
of the ``democratisation of science'', since on-demand, highly scalable cloud
  computing facilities enable researchers anywhere to carry out data-intensive
 experiments. In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), algorithms
 tend to be complex, which makes their parallelisation and deployment on cloud
 platforms a non-trivial task. This paper presents a new, unique cloud-based
platform for large-scale NLP research -- GATECloud.net. It enables researchers
 to carry out data-intensive NLP experiments by harnessing the vast, on-demand
 compute power of the Amazon cloud. Important infrastructural issues are dealt
 with by the platform, completely transparently for the researcher: load
balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual
machines, security, and fault tolerance. We also include a cost-benefit
analysis and usage evaluation.}

annote = {Firstly, presents an analysis of the types of content discussed by political candidates, comparing them on parametric graphs. The values found are assumed to represent the alignments of parties, and distance between them is used to show political proximity between parties and politicians.

They argue that that numebr of mentions of a party on twitter alone can be an excellent predictor of electoral success, even without analysing the content of the tweets.

Additionally, they point out that potential coalition partners are often mentioned together in tweets.

Their approach relies on a text analysis package which only works for english, so tweets must first be translated. They argue that this is okay because the analysis is carried out on bag-of-words models.},

abstract = {While much of a company's knowledge can be found in text repositories, current content management systems have limited capabilities for structuring and interpreting documents. In the emerging Semantic Web, search, interpretation and aggregation can be addressed by ontology-based semantic mark-up. In this paper, we examine semantic annotation, identify a number of requirements, and review the current generation of semantic annotation systems. This analysis shows that, while there is still some way to go before semantic annotation tools will be able to address fully all the knowledge management needs, research in the area is active and making good progress.},

abstract = {Abstract: The Web contains a large amount of documents and an increasing quantity of structured datain the form of RDF triples. Many of these triples are annotations associated with documents. Whilestructured queries constitute the principal means to retrieve structured data, keyword queries aretypically used for document retrieval. Clearly, a form of hybrid search that seamlessly integrates theseformalisms to query both textual and structured data can address more complex information needs.However, hybrid search on the large scale Web environment faces several challenges. First, there is aneed for repositories that can store and index a large amount of semantic data as well as textual data indocuments, and manage them in an integrated way. Second, methods for hybrid query answering areneeded to exploit the data from such an integrated repository. These methods should be fast andscalable, and in particular, they shall support flexible ranking schemes to return not all but only themost relevant results. In this paper, we present CE\$^2\$, an integrated solution that leverages matureinformation retrieval and database technologies to support large scale hybrid search. For scalable andintegrated management of data, CE\$^2\$ integrates off-the-shelf database solutions with invertedindexes. Efficient hybrid query processing is supported through novel data structures and algorithmswhich allow advanced ranking schemes to be tightly integrated. Furthermore, a concrete rankingscheme is proposed to take features from both textual and structured data into account. Experimentsconducted on DBpedia and Wikipedia show that CE\$^2\$ can provide good performance in terms ofboth effectiveness and efficiency.}

abstract = {Automatic extraction of semantic relationships between entity
 instances in an ontology is useful for attaching richer semantic metadata to
 documents. In this paper we propose an SVM based approach to hierarchical
 relation extraction, using features derived automatically from a number of
 GATE-based open-source language processing tools. In comparison to the
  previous works, we use several new features including part of speech tag,
 entity subtype, entity class, entity role, semantic representation of sentence
 and WordNet synonym set. The impact of the features on the performance is
 investigated, as is the impact of the relation classification hierarchy. The
 results show there is a trade-off among these factors for relation extraction
 and the features containing more information such as semantic ones can improve
  the performance of the ontological relation extraction task}

annote = {Presents an approach to summarising individual posts in microblogs using the responses to them.

Posts are characterised as interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat, and the summarisation depends on that classification. Intention classification is performed using a 6-gram classification model along with some other features such as the precense of URLs and file pointers.

Conversations are summarised by classifying response pairs - where one message specifically responds to a previous one. These sets of response pairs are grouped to identify different topics within the same conversation.

The relevancy of responses to questions is also detected. Positive/negative sentiment is extracted when the user has shared a URL, and a pie chart is created from the results.

An interactive search system is developed which displays these summaries when a post is clicked.

ABSTRACT = "         This article is W.'s response to Barwise and                            Perry's Situation         Semantics. W. suggests that B \& P, while  remaining          within the         realist tradition, have moved the  'semantic fulcrum'   by        accepting         a different view of what  constitute real things,   the        primitives         into which reality is  carved up, from the   Montagovians. B  \&       P         accept individuals,  relations and locations   as primitive,  and               do not require  possible worlds to figure in   their ontology.  While                acknowledging that their formal treatment   allows for more  elegant                handling of things like discourse   situations, etc. he  feels they            have     not addressed the real   problem, which for him  involves rejecting            the     realist assumption   that there is a reality  independent of            language use     for  language  to map onto. For W.  meaning is  determined           by use of      language  within a community, and  language  should be           viewed as  activity      rather than description. He   introduces 2 analaogies:            (1) economics      could suppose a value   function which maps each            object onto a real  value     and market   activity could then be viewed            as perturbations  to the  real     value  - W. suggests that a better            perspective is to  view value  as      determined by activities of buying            and selling (2)  relation of   roads  to    terrain - terrain conditions            road placement  but does  not   determine it   -  road placement is          more   fundamentally   determined by   prior human  needs   and wants         -  who needs   to go   where. W. suggests   situation  semantics may           be  useful for     describing increasingly more    sophisticated artificial            languages     (e.g. computer languages)  where   the assumptions it           makes  about a     neatly d
ivided world  existing   independently of         the   language   hold    true."

training set. This is particularly true when learning from smaller datasets which often have a few positive training examples and many negative ones. This paper takes two popular IE algorithms SVM and Perceptron and demonstrates how the introduction of an uneven margins parameter can improve the results on imbalanced training data in IE. Our experiments demonstrate that the uneven margin was indeed helpful, especially when learning from few examples. Essentially, the smaller the training set is, the more beneficial the uneven margin can be. We also compare our systems to other state-of-theart
algorithms on several benchmarking corpora for IE.},

 to make use of knowledge from the target ontology in order to improve semantic
 annotation results. However, very few approaches exploit the ontology structure
 itself, and those that do so, have some limitations. This paper introduces a
 hierarchical learning approach for IE, which uses the target ontology as an
 essential part of the extraction process, by taking into account the
 relations between concepts. The approach is evaluated on the largest available
 seman-tically annotated corpus. The results demonstrate clearly the benefits of
 using knowledge from the ontology as input to the information extraction
 process. We also demonstrate the advantages of our approach over other
 state-of-the-art learning systems on a commonly used benchmark dataset}

abstract = {Some classification problems, such as the NTCIR-06 F-term patent
 classification task, have general or specific relations between the target
 class labels. Consequently, in such cases, it is desirable that the relations
 among the labels can be taken into account in the evaluation measures. For
 example, if a system assigns an incorrect label to one instance and the
 assigned label has close relation with the true label, then the system may
 deserve some credit, rather than being given no credit at all as is the case
 with conventional evaluation measures.

In this paper we propose some new evaluation measures based on relations among
 classification labels, which can be seen as the label relation sensitive
 version of some important evaluation measures such as averaged precision and
 F-measure. We also present the results of applying the new evaluation measures
 to all submitted runs for the NTCIR-6 F-term patent classification task. The
 new measure did change the ranking positions of some runs (including the top
 runs in some cases) made by the conventional measure, while it kept the ranking
 position of many other runs}

 used to adapt the approach for the specifics of the F-term patent
 classification subtask at NTCIR-6 Patent Retrieval Task. Our system obtained
 the best results according to two of the three measures used for performance
 evaluation. Moreover, the results from some additional experiments demonstrate
 that our system has benefited from the SVM adaptations which we carried out. It
 also benefited from using the full patent text in addition to using the F-term
 description as extra training material. However, our results using an
 SVMvariant designed for hierarchical classification were much worse than those
 achieved with flat SVM classification. At the end of the paper we discuss the
 possible reasons for this, in the context of the F-term classification task}

 presents and discusses the results of our system on the opinion analysis task.
 It also presents our experiments of opinion analysis on the two corpora MPQA
 and NTCIR-6, by using our learning based system. Our system was base on the SVM
 learning. It achieved state of the art results on the MPQA corpus for the two
 problems, opinionated sentence recognition and opinion holder extraction. The
 results using the NTCIR-6 English corpus for both training and testing are
 certainly among the first ones. Our results on the opinionated sentence
 recognition sub-task of the NTCIR-6 were encouraging. The results on the
 English evaluation of the NTCIR-6 opinion analysis task were obtained from the
 models learned from the MPQA corpus. The lower results on the NTCIR-6 opinion
 holder extraction subtask, in comparison with those using each corpus for both
 training and testing, may possibly show that there exist substantial
 differences between the MPQA corpus and the NTCIR-6 English corpus}
